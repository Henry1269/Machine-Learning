**Background on the Automatidata scenario**

Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet them. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. Based on data that TLC has gathered, the agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a **regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride**.

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

**NYC OPEN DATA 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data**

This dataset includes trip records from all trips completed in yellow taxis from in NYC during 2017. Records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (TPEP). 
This project uses a dataset called 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv. The data was gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission and published by the city of New York as part of their NYC Open Data program. To improve the learning experience and shorten runtimes, a sample was drawn from the 113 million rows in the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data table. The dataset contains 408,294 rows – each row represents a different trip 18 columns.
